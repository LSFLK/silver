# Silver
The Silver project aims to reinvent email and digital communication that is suitable for government scale deployment. We are looking to make it in two stages: 1.0 to just provide "regular" email and 2.0 to reinvent communication and collaboration.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- A dedicated Linux server with a static public IP address. You also require root access and port access control.
- Domain with DNS control

### Minimum hardware requirements
- 4GB of memory
- 1GB of swap

### Software 
- Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux) and [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
  
### DNS setup
You own <a>example.com</a> and want to send email as person@example.com.

You will need to add a few records to your DNS control panel.

> [!Note]
> Replace example.com and 12.34.56.78 in the below example with your domain and ip address.

| DNS Record | Name        | Value                                                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| A          | mail        | 12.34.56.78                                            |
| A          | example.com | 12.34.56.78                                            |
| MX         | example.com | mail.example.com                                       |
| TXT        | example.com | "v=spf1 ip4:12.34.56.78 ~all"                          |
| TXT        | _dmarc      | "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com" |
| PTR        | 12.34.56.78 | mail.example.com                                       |

> [!Tip]
> PTR records usually are set through your hosting provider. 

### Server Setup
-  Clone the repository and navigate to the services folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LSFLK/silver.git
cd silver/services
```

### Configuration
- Open [`silver.yaml`](https://github.com/LSFLK/silver/blob/main/conf/silver.yaml) with a text editor.

- Enter your domain name.

- Run `bash ../scripts/setup/setup.sh` to setup the configs.

- Run `bash ../scripts/service/start-silver.sh` to start the mail server.

- Replace the dkim record below with the output you get after running the `setup.sh` script

| DNS Record | Name            | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TXT        | mail._domainkey | "v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDYZd3CAas0+81zf13cvtO6o0+rlGx8ZobYQXRR9W8qcJOeO1SiQGx8F4/DjZE1ggujOaY1bkt8OnUg7vG7/bk5PNe05EHJrg344krodqCJrVI74ZzEB77Z1As395KX6/XqbQxBepQ8D5+RpGFOHitI443G/ZWgZ6BRyaaE6t3u0QIDAQAB" |

> [!Important] 
> Ensure that your dkim value is correctly formatted.

### Adding users

- To add more users to your email server, open up [`users.yaml`](https://github.com/LSFLK/silver/blob/main/conf/users.yaml), and add their usernames and run the following command.

```bash
# silver/services
bash ../scripts/user/add_user.sh
```
- Follow the prompts to add a new user.

### Testing your setup
- Now that you have a working email server, you can test your configuration using the following links/scripts.
