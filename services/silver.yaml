# This file contains the primary configuration for your mail server.
# --- Domain Configuration ---
# This is the most critical setting. It defines the primary domain name
# that your mail server will be responsible for.
#
# âž¡ IMPORTANT:
#   - Replace the empty value below with your actual domain name.
#   - Do NOT include 'www.' or 'https://'. Just the domain itself.
#   - This domain must be a real, registered domain that you own.

# Example (this line is commented out and is just a guide):
# domain: your-awesome-domain.com
